The goal behind the AI Cart Project is to develop a fully functioning prototype of an autonomous shopping cart with a team using a microcontroller, 3D printer, and as
much hardware as needed (i.g. Ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, etc.).

This project was accomplished successfully by designing an autonomous shopping cart that can avoid
objects, recognize the user, make customer service call, and provide the user interface using a touch
screen.

The AI Cart was built and configured using:
* Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM).
* AutoDesk Fusion 360 and a 3D printer.
* Python scripting language (tensorflow object recognition A.I.).
* C programming language to control the ultrasonic sensors and motors.
* GTK 3.0 (to create the user interface).
* L293D motor driver IC.
* LTC2943 PCB to show the battery level.
* Touch screen for the user interface.
